# Bolivian Signal Detection (BSD)
The project is Sign language detection from finger and face trajectory. For this it was necessary to create a dataset consisting of videos of 20 different signs, from this dataset we proceeded with the pre-processing part to normalize the number of frames and the size of the videos.  Mediapipe was then used to record the trajectories of the hand and parts of the face such as the eyes. Finally, a model was applied for data training, evaluation and testing.

## Motivation
This project took as a reference a problem present in society: social inclusion. We consider that a group of people who often lack opportunities are those with hearing disabilities, in that sense we wanted to support inclusion through this model that allows to recognize sign language automatically, in this way we achieve a support for a more effective communication.

## Tecnologies
- Mediapipe
- Tensorflow 
- Google Drive
- Google Colab

## Important functionalities
Undoubtedly the most interesting functionality of the project is the method of using Mediapipe for optimal recognition based on the trajectories of the different parts of the hand and face. For the fingers, we use different colors, since the trajectory of each finger has a lot of weight for the prediction of the signs, additionally the use of Mediapipe in the face, such as the eyes, is due to the fact that many signs are similar but the fact of having referenced the face, provides a necessary support for a correct detection.
